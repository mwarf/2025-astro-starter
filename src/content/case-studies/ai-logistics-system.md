# AI-Powered Logistics System

## Challenge

Global Transit faced increasing complexity in managing their logistics network, with inefficient routes leading to higher costs and delayed deliveries. They needed a smart solution to optimize their operations.

## Solution

We developed an AI-powered logistics system using cutting-edge technologies:

- Created machine learning models for route optimization
- Implemented real-time traffic and weather data integration
- Built predictive analytics for demand forecasting
- Developed dynamic scheduling algorithms
- Created a real-time monitoring dashboard

## Results

The implementation led to remarkable improvements:

- 35% improvement in route optimization
- 28% reduction in fuel costs
- 45% decrease in delivery delays
- 20% increase in fleet utilization
- 15% reduction in operational costs

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- Python backend with TensorFlow
- AWS Lambda for serverless computing
- Real-time data processing with Kinesis
- MongoDB for data storage
- REST APIs for system integration

### AI Components
